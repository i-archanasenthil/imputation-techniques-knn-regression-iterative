**Various Imputation Techniques: KNN, Regression, and Iterative**

This repository demonstrates the implementation of various imputation techniques to handle missing data in datasets. Missing data is a common problem in data science and machine learning, and proper imputation can significantly improve model performance.

**Introduction**

Handling missing data is crucial for building accurate predictive models. This repository covers three commonly used imputation techniques:

KNN Imputation

Regression Imputation

Iterative Imputation

These methods are implemented using Python and can be applied to various datasets to replace missing values with estimated ones.

**Techniques**

**KNN Imputation**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation works by finding the 'k' closest samples to the missing value and using their values to estimate the missing one. The proximity between samples is determined by a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. This method is useful when the data has complex patterns that simpler methods like mean or median imputation cannot capture.

**How it works:**

For each missing value, find the 'k' nearest neighbors based on the available data.

Impute the missing value by averaging the values from the nearest neighbors.

**Regression Imputation**

Regression imputation involves using the relationship between the missing values and other variables to predict the missing data. This is done by fitting a regression model (linear or logistic) to the available data and predicting the missing values.

**How it works:**

Build a regression model using the features that are not missing.

Predict the missing values using the model.

**Iterative Imputation**

Iterative imputation is a more advanced technique that models each feature with missing values as a function of other features in a round-robin fashion. It iteratively imputes missing values until convergence. This method can be more accurate than KNN and regression for complex datasets.

**How it works:**

For each feature with missing values, model it as a function of the other features.

Impute the missing values and repeat the process until the imputation stabilizes.
